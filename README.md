# AI-Based Security Camera System

In an era marked by increasing security concerns and the persistent need for more advanced and proactive surveillance solutions, this research introduces a groundbreaking project: an AI-Powered Security Camera System specifically designed to augment safety and security in a variety of settings. With the prevalence of AI and computer vision technologies, this system harnesses the power of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, enabling real-time identification and response to incidents, including accidents and suspicious activities. This project represents a significant stride toward an enhanced and automated approach to security surveillance.

The contemporary landscape is characterized by a myriad of security challenges, ranging from accidents with potentially severe consequences to the potential for malicious activities that can threaten lives and property. Conventional surveillance systems have typically relied on human intervention for threat identification and response, often resulting in delayed reactions and missed incidents. In contrast, the AI-Powered Security Camera System presented here bridges this gap by combining state-of-the-art technologies into a unified, intelligent surveillance system.

## Introduction

The AI-Based Security Camera System is an innovative solution that combines AI and computer vision technologies to enhance security surveillance. This system is designed to detect accidents and suspicious activities in real-time, providing an efficient means of threat mitigation. The project integrates the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, Google Firebase for user authentication and data management, and the Streamlit web interface for real-time monitoring.


## Features

- Real-time accident detection
- Suspicious activity recognition
- Secure user authentication with Google Firebase
- Streamlit-based web interface for easy monitoring
- Continuous improvement through periodic model updates

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the AI-Based Security Camera System, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Google Firebase account
- Streamlit (for the web interface)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-security-camera.git
   cd ai-security-camera
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project and obtain the necessary credentials.
   - Replace the Firebase configuration details in `config/firebase_config.json`.

## Usage

1. Start the system:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Access the Streamlit web interface at `http://localhost:8501` to monitor the security camera system in real-time.
